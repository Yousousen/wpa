This is just an example I put together using different plotting libraries, one 
introduced in the documentation on PGSTAR, and one introduced in the [add-ons 
page of MESA](https://cococubed.com/mesa_market/add-ons.html)
on plotting with python using the LOGS files afterwards.

I don't think we need to plot in python per se, but it may be useful if we 
didn't make sufficient plots or saved them during the simulation runs, or if 
want to continue working with a language that is a little more familiar to us.
