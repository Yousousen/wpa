## Useful resources

[MESA summer school 2021](https://jschwab.github.io/mesa-2021/). It provides tutorials that familiarizes us with the code and software system.

[Hand-on tutorial on plotting](https://docs.mesastar.org/en/release-r22.11.1/using_mesa/using_pgstar.html#hands-on-tutorial) gives a tutorial on using the incredible plotting system of MESA

## Project on binary star systems

Current idea is to simulate binary star systems and their properties. The following ideas are interesting.

The lifetimes of stars differ greatly depending on the properties of the two stars in the system. For instance, if one or both of the stars fills its Roche lobe, then mass transfer can happen between the stars. Hence, it is interesting to consider

1. **Mass transfer** between the stars at different stages of their evolution and compare their final stages.

Concretely, we can look at mass transfer between a donor `pre-main sequence star` / `main sequence star` / `red giant star` and a accretor `white dwarf` / `neutron star` / `black hole`.

Something else that is interesting to look at is

2. The different types of **heat transfer** within each of the two stars in a binary system.

Accretion by the accretor from the donor star can e.g. result in the donor star becoming sufficiently non-massive that convection may happen throughout the whole star like in a red dwarf (**TODO**: is this true? I just sketched the scenario, I do not know!)

Another scenario is the

3. Comparison between a **binary star system** with total mass $M$ and an **isolated star** with mass $M$.
